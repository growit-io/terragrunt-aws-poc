# Contributing

All contributions to this project are welcome. You can ask questions, report
problems, and request features using the issue tracker on GitHub. All actual
changes must be submitted as pull requests.

Commit messages in pull requests *should* be formatted according to
the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification,
with the following exceptions:

- The `scope` field is mandatory in this project and should match one of
`scope-enum` values defined in the file [commitlint.config.js](commitlint.config.js).

The maintainers of this project may have to squash all commits and create a new
commit message when merging your pull request, if your commit messages don't
follow these conventions.
