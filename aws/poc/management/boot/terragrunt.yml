# This layer uses a dedicated Terraform remote state. It is expected that this
# state will be created by running Terragrunt as the organization's management
# account root user. This Terraform remote state should not contain sensitive
# information. It merely stores the configuration information of all the other
# S3 buckets for Terraform remote states used by the other layers of this tier.
remote_state:
  backend: s3
  config:
    # You can pick any AWS region for the initial Terraform remote state, but
    # it should be one that is close to the location from which you will most
    # often run Terraform in order to minimize network latency.
    region: eu-central-1

    # You can freely choose a name for the initial Terraform remote state S3
    # bucket, for example, if you don't want to use the default name that is
    # generated by the parent terragrunt.hcl, or if the generated bucket name
    # is not available anymore.
