# This group should normally be empty. Only if an incident or other exceptional
# situation happens may human users be added to this group by the root user. As
# soon as the situation is resolved, this group should be emptied again.

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess

# This group should include human and system users who need to possess permanent
# privileges to administer any member account in the organization, and to create
# new member accounts. Without further restrictions in place, this will include
# the ability to assume any IAM role in any member account, including production
# accounts.

# This group should include all human and system users who need to manage access
# policies and user identities in the management account of the organization.
SecurityAdministrators:
  path: /
  policies:
    - SecurityAdministratorAccess

# This group should include human and system users who need to possess permanent
# privileges to administer any member account in the organization, and to create
# new member accounts. Consequently, it also grants the required permissions to
# create and destroy buckets used as S3 Terraform remote state backend storage
# in the management account. Human users should normally not be a member of this
# group, but may be added temporarily to fix issues which can't be resolved with
# the existing Terraform automation, or when the Terraform automation is broken.
